I write this post in English. Because:
- chinese input method is not so good in Linux and st2 is good for my weak eyes.
- And another language may help me clean my mind.
- I use sublime-text-2 not vim.

I am a programmer. I like hacker which create amazing things and I want be one of them. 

I start a project named Anwen and you can find it at anwensf.com now. It is not so good because I have little time now.

I also like reading good books which make me think more fantasy or more clear.

And I meet problems.
- I have little free time.
- I have too much things todo.
- I can not choose one which I want to do for this moment.

List sth I want to do today:
- learn python and how to code
- make anwen better
- play with my girl and bring her more interest things
- I also want start make a html5-multi-player-mmorpg-sf-game
- read books: sf zfzdr
- clean my notes
...

And from which?
- py? no
- anwen? I should clean my mind and make clean doc
- play what? 
- I should finish the story first.
- read? I think I know the truth and I lack act more for this moment.
- clean notes? emm... yes. clean my heart.

Some logs about clean:
I always make my pc a mess
- I download many pics, softwares gists which I may not use
- I clone many project on github, but just a sallow study
- made too many plans
